Usage:

list [path] [options] [output filename]

    Where [options] are
        -o    overwrites the previous file, if it exists
        -j    generate listing in JSON format
        -r    recursively list files (not implemented)



Run without options to generate a listing of all files in the current directory.  The default output file name will be in the form of "List of files in [directory name].txt".  If a file with that name already exists, it is renamed to have "(old)" appended before the extension unless the -o switch is present, in which case it is overwritten.

By default, the output file has one filename on each line, with a single newline on the last line of the file.

The output for the -j switch (JSON format) will be as follows:

{
"short directory name" : [ "file_0", "file_1", "file_2", ... "file_n" ]
}
